# A daemon that is used to start, stop, restart, etc. the underlying Node.js
# instances that make up Razor and to ensure that they stay running as long
# as this daemon process continues to run.  It also checks the status of the
# underlying database instance that is used by Razor to ensure that it is
# running and throws an error (and exits) if that database stops running.
# Finally, this daemon will be used to check the timings on tasks that are
# running under Razor, but that functionality is, as of now, unimplemented.
